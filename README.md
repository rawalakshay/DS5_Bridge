  <strong>DS5 Bridge 1.7.0 is live.</strong><br>
  This release includes controller microphone support, Audio Haptics, Trigger
  Lab, controller personas, chords, and companion firmware tools.
</p>

DS5 Bridge lets you use a real Sony DualSense or DualSense Edge controller
wirelessly on a Windows PC through a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W. The controller pairs
to the Pico over Bluetooth, and the Pico plugs into your PC over USB.

The companion app gives you a clean place to adjust audio, haptics, trigger
strength, lighting, button remaps, shortcuts, firmware tools, and other
controller behavior without rebuilding firmware.

## Quick Start

1. Download the firmware `.uf2` and Windows companion installer from
   [Releases](https://github.com/SundayMoments/DS5_Bridge/releases/latest).
2. With the Pico 2 W unplugged, hold `BOOTSEL`, then connect it to your PC.
3. Copy the `.uf2` file onto the Pico drive that appears in Windows.
4. Briefly press `BOOTSEL` once, then wait about one second for the Pico to open
   its controller pairing window.
5. Put the DualSense controller into Bluetooth pairing mode by holding `Create`
   and `PS` until the lightbar rapidly blinks blue.
6. Wait for the controller to pair to the Pico, not directly to Windows.
7. Install and open DS5 Bridge. The Overview page should show the connected
   bridge and firmware version.

Once the controller connects to the Pico, Windows sees it as a normal
DualSense-compatible USB controller.

## BOOTSEL Button Gestures

After DS5 Bridge firmware is installed, the Pico's `BOOTSEL` button controls
controller connections and firmware maintenance:

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| One brief press | If no controller is connected, open the controller pairing window. If a controller is connected, disconnect it while preserving its saved pairing. |
| Two brief presses | Switch the bridge mode between DualSense and Stellaris (Xbox). The onboard LED blinks once for DualSense mode and twice for Stellaris mode, and the bridge re-enumerates on your PC under the new identity. The bridge always starts in DualSense mode after a power cycle. The Stellaris-only image has no second mode, so there this drives diagnostics instead: the first press types a report and walks you through a guided button capture, the second runs the rumble probe, and the third stops. Point a text editor at it first. |
| Three brief presses | Reboot into USB firmware flashing mode. The Pico appears as a drive so you can copy a `.uf2` file onto it. |
| Hold for about 1.5 seconds | Forget all saved controller pairings, disconnect the current controller, and open a fresh pairing window. |

A one- or two-press gesture is performed after the Pico waits about one second
to make sure another press is not coming. For a new controller, briefly press
`BOOTSEL` once, wait for the pairing window to open, then hold `Create` and `PS`
on the controller until its lightbar rapidly blinks blue.

## Companion App Tour

The companion app is where you check the bridge, adjust the controller, and save
the setup you actually want to play with.

### Overview

See connection health, firmware version, battery, audio route, Bluetooth signal
quality, host persona, and the settings most likely to matter during play.

</p>

### Audio

Control the controller speaker, headphone-jack route, microphone level, speaker
gain, and buffer length.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/app-audio.png" width="680" alt="Audio controls in the DS5 Bridge companion app">
</p>

### Haptics

Adjust HD haptics, classic rumble, feedback boost, and audio buffer length, then
test the feel before opening a game.

</p>

### Audio Haptics

Turn system audio or an app session into controller haptic feedback.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Triggers

Set adaptive trigger strength, try effects, or open Trigger Lab for per-trigger
profiles.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Trigger Lab

Build and preview adaptive trigger effects before applying them to the controller.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/app-trigger-lab.png" width="680" alt="Trigger Lab controls in the DS5 Bridge companion app">
</p>

### Lighting

Choose lightbar brightness and color, or let the app manage lighting behavior
for you.

</p>

### Button Remapping

Change what each controller button does, then save the remap when you are happy
with it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/app-button-remapping.png" width="680" alt="Button remapping controls in the DS5 Bridge companion app">
</p>

### System

Manage profiles, mute button behavior, polling rate, host persona, diagnostics,
and device repair.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/app-system.png" width="680" alt="System controls in the DS5 Bridge companion app">
</p>

### Chords

Create reusable keyboard, media, and controller actions, then assign them to
starter chords.

DualSense Edge reserves LFN/RFN plus the face buttons for onboard profile
switching. Enable **Block Edge Profile Switching** in Bridge Settings to use
those combinations as DS5 Bridge chords; turning it off keeps the assignments
saved but inactive.

</p>

### Bridge Settings

Set theme, UI scale, tray and startup behavior, firmware maintenance, power
saving, LEDs, shortcuts, idle disconnect, and PC sleep disconnect.

## Troubleshooting

- Use the companion app and firmware from the same release when possible.
- For first-time flashing, hold `BOOTSEL` before plugging the Pico 2 W into the
  PC. The Pico should appear as a USB drive.
- Pair the controller to the Pico, not Windows. Hold `Create` and `PS` until the
  lightbar rapidly blinks blue. If the Pico is not already searching, briefly
  press `BOOTSEL` once and wait about one second first.
- If audio, mic, haptics, or flashing behave oddly, try a direct USB port and a
  data-capable micro-USB cable before using a hub.
- If controller audio sounds doubled, distorted, or too loud, restart your PC,
  reopen DS5 Bridge, and run the speaker test again.
- If Windows keeps stale or duplicate controller/audio devices, use
  [Windows device cleanup](docs/windows-device-cleanup.md) or System >
  Emergency Device Repair.
- Battery level may be inaccurate while the controller is charging.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.
- Sony DualSense or DualSense Edge controller.
- Data-capable USB cable with a micro-USB end for the Pico 2 W.
- Windows for the companion app.

## For Developers

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for local build requirements,
firmware build commands, companion app setup, audio helper notes, and packaging
steps.

## Project Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main.cpp` | Pico startup, watchdog handling, USB task loop, and HID report bridge. |
| `src/bt.cpp` | Bluetooth inquiry, pairing, L2CAP HID channels, and report queueing. |
| `src/audio.cpp` | USB audio ingestion, haptic resampling, Opus speaker encoding, and audio packet assembly. |
| `src/companion.cpp` | Vendor HID companion protocol, status reports, command ACKs, and runtime setting dispatch. |
| `src/usb.cpp` | TinyUSB audio control callbacks and runtime settings fallback. |
| `src/usb_descriptors.c` | USB device, configuration, HID report, audio, and string descriptors. |
| `companion/` | Electron companion app source, protocol parser, HID service, assets, and UI. |
| `companion/native/AudioHelper/` | Windows audio helper used by the companion app for audio sessions, haptics mirroring, endpoint setup, and media integrations. |
| `.github/workflows` | CI and release builds. |

## Development Notes

- The bridge presents itself to the host as a standard DualSense-compatible USB
  controller for compatibility.
- The companion app requires firmware built with the companion HID interface
  enabled.
- The project controls runtime behavior through the bridge and does not write
  controller-side profiles.
- Battery level is not reported accurately while the controller is charging.
- During development, Windows may keep stale controller or audio endpoint
  records after descriptor testing. Use
  [docs/windows-device-cleanup.md](docs/windows-device-cleanup.md) only if you
  run into device or endpoint issues while testing.
